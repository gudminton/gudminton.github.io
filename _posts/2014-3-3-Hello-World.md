# Order of the rules

## 1. The Court

The court is a rectangle, approximately 24 meters long, and approximately 11 meters wide.  

The court is divided across the middle by a net suspended by a cord or metal cable which passes over or is attached to two net posts at a height of approximately 1 meter. The net should be fully extended so that it completely fills the space between the two net posts and it must be of a sufficiently small mesh so that the ball cannot pass through it. The height of the net should be 0.9 meters at the center, where it can be held down tightly by a strap. A band should cover the cord or metal cable and the top of the net. 

The lines at the ends of the courts are called baselines and the lines at the sides of the court are called sidelines. All court measurements should be made to the outside of the lines and all lines of the court should be of the same color clearly contrasting with the color of the surface.
