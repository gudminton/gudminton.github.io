# Gudminton Rulebook

## Game Setup

### Location
1. Gudminton is to be played on a regulation tennis court with a net.

### Equipment
1. A regulation sized soccer ball inflated to 5psi is used.

## Gameplay

### Serving

1. The ball must be served behind the baseline. The server must not cross the baseline while serving. If the server crosses the line while in the motion of serving the ball, the opposing team, or the referee if present, may request a reserve. There is no scoring penalty if the server crosses the line.

2. The ball is served by kicking the ball only. A placekick, dropkick, or punt may be used.

3. The served ball must land on the opponent's side of the net within the boxed area of the court. A ball landing on the line is considered in the box.

4. Each team will serve 5 times in a row alternating after the 5th serve.

### Play

1. The ball may come in contact with any part of a player except for the hand, forearm, elbow, and lower half of the upper arm. It is acceptable for the ball to come in contact with the shoulder of the player. (this area extends typically as far as a standard short sleeve t-shirt toward the elbow)

2. The ball may only bounce on a team's side of the net a maximum of 3 times. If the ball bounces a 4th time, a point is awarded to the opposing team. The 2nd and 3rd bounce may bounce anywhere on the team's side of the net, including the area outside the box.

3. The ball may be played after striking a player, the ground, the net, surrounding fence, or other structures deemed to be part of the court.

4. The ball may go around the net. (This could occur as a result of bouncing off of the fence/wall, or by a player striking it around the net)

5. A player may not touch the ground on the opponent's side of the net. He may however strike the ball while it is in the air over the opponent's side so as long as he is not striking the net.

5. A player may not touch the net with the intent of manipulating the net's position.

6. A ball the is rolling on the ground is automatically deemed to have exceeded the maximum allowed bounces.

### Scoring

1. A point is scored when the opposing team allows the ball to exceed the maximum number of bounces.

2. A point is scored is the ball is struck by a player with their hand, forearm, elbow, or lower half of the upper arm.

3. The goal is to score 21 points with at least a 2 point spread before the opposing team does. If each team has 20 or more points, the first team to have a 2 point lead wins. If a team has 21 points and the opposing team has 19 points or less, they win.
